# | Row        | Brick edges (prefix sums) |
# | ---------- | ------------------------- |
# | \[1,2,2,1] | 1, 3, 5                   |
# | \[3,1,2]   | 3, 4                      |
# | \[1,3,2]   | 1, 4                      |
# | \[2,4]     | 2                         |
# | \[3,1,2]   | 3, 4                      |
# | \[1,3,1,1] | 1, 4, 5                   |

# So, we record how often each edge appears (excluding final edge):
# {
#   1: 3 times,
#   2: 1 time,
#   3: 3 times,
#   4: 4 times,
#   5: 2 times
# }

# â†’ The best edge is at position 4, which appears in 4 rows.
